        Impress.js doesn't depend on any external stylesheet. Script adds all styles it needs for
        presentation to work.
        
        This style below contains styles only for demo presentation. Browse it to see how impress.js
        classes are used to style presentation steps, or how to apply fallback styles, but I don't want
        you to use them directly in your presentation.
        
        Be creative, build your own. We don't really want all impress.js presentations to look the same,
        do we?
        
        When creating your own presentation get rid of this file. Start from scratch, it's fun!

    That's the wrapper for your presentation steps. In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    It doesn't have to be a `<div>`. Only `id` is important here as that's how the script find it.
    
    It's worth to notice the `impress-not-supported` class. This class means, that browser doesn't
    support features required by impress.js, so you can apply some fallback styles in your CSS.
    It's not necessary to add it manually on this element. If the script detects that browser is not
    good enough it will add this class, but keeping it in HTML means that users without JavaScript
    will also get fallback styles.
    
    The class name on this element also depends on currently active presentation step. More details about
    it can be found below, when `hint` element is being described.
    
-->
<div id="impress" class="impress-not-supported">

    <div class="fallback-message">
        <p>Your browser <b>doesn't support the features required</b> by impress.js, so you are presented with a simplified version of this presentation.</p>
        <p>For the best experience please use the latest <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Safari</b> or <b>Firefox</b> browser. Upcoming version 10 of Internet Explorer <i>should</i> also handle it.</p>
    </div>

    <!--
        
        Here is where interesting thing start to happen.
        
        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        
        Positioning information is passed through data attributes.
        
        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'.
        
        It will not be rotated or scaled.
        
    -->

    And now it gets really exiting! We move into third dimension!

    Along with `data-x` and `data-y`, you can define the position on third (Z) axis, with
    `data-z`. In the example below we use `data-z="-3000"` meaning that element should be
    positioned far away from us (by 3000px).

  Hint is not related to impress.js in any way.

  But it can show you how to use impress.js features in creative way.

  When the presentation step is shown (selected) it's element get's the class of "active" and `#impress` root
  element get's the class based on active step id `step-ID` (where ID is the step id)... It probably is not
  so clear because of all these IDs in here, so for example when the first step (the one with id of `bored`)
  is active, `#impress` element get a class of `step-bored`.

  This class is used by this hint below. Check CSS file to see how it's shown with delayed CSS animation.

  ...

  And when it comes to this piece of JavaScript below ... kids, don't do this at home ;)
  It's just a quick and dirty workaround to get different content for touch devices.
  In a real world it should be at least placed in separate JS file ... and the touch content should be
  probably just hidden somewhere in HTML, not hard-coded in the script.

  Just sayin' ;)

  -->
  <div class="hint">
    <p>Use a spacebar or arrow keys to navigate</p>
  </div>
  <script>
    if ("ontouchstart" in document.documentElement) { 
      document.querySelector(".hint").innerHTML = "<p>Tap on the left or right to navigate</p>";
    }
  </script>

  <!--

  Last, but not least.

  To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
  I strongly encourage to minify it first.

  In here I just include full source of the script to make it more readable.

  You also need to call a `impress()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
  And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
  because it should be done when the whole document is ready.
  Of course you can wrap it in any kind of "DOM ready" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)

  -->
  <script src="impress/js/impress.js"></script>
  <script>impress();</script>

  <!--

  The `impress()` function also gives you access to API to control the presentation.

  Just store the result of the call:

  var api = impress();

  and you will get three functions you can call:

  `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,
  `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation
  `api.goto( stepElement ) - moves the presentation to given step element (the DOM element of the step).

  You can also simply call `impress()` again to get the API, so `impress().next()` is also allowed.
  Don't worry, it wont initialize the presentation again.

  For some example uses of this API check the last part of the source of impress.js where the API
  is used in event handlers.

Now you know more or less everything you need to build your first impress.js presentation, but before
you start...

Oh, you've already cloned the code from GitHub?

You have it open in text editor?

Stop right there!

That's not how you create awesome presentations. This is only a code. Implementation of the idea that
first needs to grow in your mind.

So if you want to build great presentation take a pencil and piece of paper. And turn off the computer.

Sketch, draw and write. Brainstorm your ideas on a paper. Try to build a mind-map of what you'd like
to present. It will get you closer and closer to the layout you'll build later with impress.js.

Get back to the code only when you have your presentation ready on a paper. It doesn't make sense to do
it earlier, because you'll only waste your time fighting with positioning of useless points.

If you think I'm crazy, please put your hands on a book called "Presentation Zen". It's all about 
creating awesome and engaging presentations.

Think about it. 'Cause impress.js may not help you, if you have nothing interesting to say.

Are you still reading this?

For real?

I'm impressed! Feel free to let me know that you got that far (I'm @bartaz on Twitter), 'cause I'd like
to congratulate you personally :)

But you don't have to do it now. Take my advice and take some time off. Make yourself a cup of coffee, tea,
or anything you like to drink. And raise a glass for me ;)

Cheers!
